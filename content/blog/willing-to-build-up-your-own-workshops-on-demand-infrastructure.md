[T﻿he Workshops-on-Demand](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshops/) have been an important asset for the HPE Developer Community for the last 2 years. We lately reached more than 4000 registered workshops. The project was used during physical and virtual events like HPE Discover, HPE Technical Symposium Summit, but also during Open Source events like OSS CON or Kube Con. Overtime, people have actually asked us how they could setup their own Workshops-on-Demand infrastructure. 

A﻿s a consequence, we decided over the course of the Year 2022 to open source the project.
